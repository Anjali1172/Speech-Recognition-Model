# Speech-Recognition-Model
This Speech-recognition combines accuracy of recording your voice input in real time and comparing it with pre- recorded audio sample to match the spoken word and calculate its energy to predict the actual word. Designing a robust speech-recognition algorithm is a complex task requiring detailed knowledge of signal processing and statistical modeling.
